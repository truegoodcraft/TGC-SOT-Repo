## 1. LinkedIn – SoT Facts (Condensed from Handover)

`SOT – LINKEDIN CORE FACTS (0.2.0)`

* Account was just created on Nov 27 2025.
* Current performance (from cold start):

  * ~180 impressions over 2 days
  * +1 follower
  * 1 profile view
  * 0 search appearances last week
  * Activity tracker: **7/3 actions** (2 posts, 5 comments)

**Posting behaviour:**

* Two main posts:

  * Post #1: BUS Core intro + Method + Graph of branch history BUS-Core
  * Post #2: BUS Core “stop paying rent” demo gif (wrong-speed version)
* Both posts:

  * Talk to **makers / micro-makers**
  * Emphasize **local-first, self-hosted, ERP alternative**
  * Highlight: “I didn’t write the code, I orchestrated it with SoT + LLMs”
* Results:

  * Post #2: ~95 impressions, reactions, comments, +1 follower, strong engagement for a cold account
  * Post #1 (6h in): ~80 impressions, 18 video views, ~16s avg watch time, 3 reactions, 1 comment
* Decision: **do not** repost or correct the video in-thread → avoid splitting engagement.

**Commenting behaviour:**

* Commenting only where signal is high (AI, LLM workflows, self-hosting, indie tools).
* Style:

  * Contextual, 1–4 sentences, practical
  * No “nice post” spam, no sales hooks
* Effects:

  * “Most relevant” position on other people’s posts
  * Replies + likes from authors (Sal, Nafis, Royse, etc.)
  * Direct traffic → profile → posts

**Positioning:**

* Identity:

  * Maker, not traditional dev
  * Local-first software builder
  * Self-hosting + SoT + LLM orchestration
  * Military background: visible but not central, no flag-waving
* Preferences:

  * No hype, no motivational garbage
  * Data, deltas, repeatable loops
  * Concrete demos, not theory threads

**Platform fit (observed, not “decided”):**

* LinkedIn seems **better** for your niche than Reddit/X:

  * More “permission” to talk about product and method seriously
  * Less hostility to AI-assisted workflows
  * More overlap with indie devs / builders / ops people

**Infra intentions:**

* You want a **SoT repo** just a public SOT hold people can read (likely GitHub, not Notion).
* You like the idea of:

  * `/linkedin/posts/`
  * `/linkedin/comments/`
  * `/linkedin/metrics/`
  * `/linkedin/deltas/`
* You’re okay with making this public because none of it is sensitive.

---

## 2. Quick Delta – What This Changes For Us (LinkedIn Delta #0)

**(1) NEW FACTS / DECISIONS**

* LinkedIn is now officially part of the Method surface, not a random channel.
* You have *baseline metrics* for a cold account that prove:

  * Your content hooks
  * Comments can get you “most relevant” slots
* You have explicitly decided **not** to fix the video post by reposting → you’re prioritizing coherence over perfection.

**(2) UPDATED NARRATIVE**

* Public story is not just “I built BUS Core.” It’s:

  > “I built BUS Core with a Source-of-Truth method and I’m documenting the journey across X, Reddit, and LinkedIn as a micro study in controlled iteration.”

**(3) CLARIFICATIONS**

* LinkedIn is **not** the primary dev log (that’s GitHub / internal SoT).
* LinkedIn **is** the professional publication layer + journey proof.
* Military is background context, not brand identity.

**(4) OPEN ITEMS**

* Website + waitlist (product-facing) still need to be created and connected.
* Need a simple way to log LinkedIn deltas (probably a markdown template in a repo).
* Need first **formal “journey” post** that explains the experiment without sounding like a manifesto.

**(5) JOURNEY INSIGHT**

* Even with minimal followers, **quality comments + one solid post** are enough to light up the algorithm and pull the right kind of traffic.
* This validates your idea that “small, deliberate emissions” across multiple surfaces are more powerful than one big launch blast.

## 3. Updated LinkedIn Gameplan v0.2 (Pointform)

* **Profile**

  * Keep “BUS Core founder / local-first workshop OS” as your core identity.
  * Add GitHub + (later) product site to Featured.

* **Posts**

  * Max 1 **substantial** post per day.
  * Keep them in three buckets:

    1. Product demos (BUS Core running)
    2. Method / SoT insights
    3. Journey updates (“what changed + what I learned”)

* **Comments**

  * Target: 3–5 **high-signal** comments per active day on:

    * AI dev workflows
    * self-hosting
    * agents / orchestration
    * indie builder stories
  * Keep tone: practical, specific, non-salesy.

* **Tracking**

  * After each post session:

    * Log a tiny delta (5 bullets max) in `/linkedin/deltas/`
    * Capture 1 “journey insight” about how the post/engagement feeds back into BUS Core or the Method.

* **Traffic type**

  * Optimize for:

    * Makers and small shops
    * Builders who might become collaborators / plugin authors
    * People who care about local, not hype SaaS
  * Lightly route them later to: **product site + waitlist** once live.



Below is **everything we’ve learned so far from the LinkedIn + “get eyes on BUS Core / Pro” push**, pulled from *this project’s chat + the screenshots/metrics you shared*. It’s exhaustive on purpose.

---

## 0) Your current “brand position” (what you’re implicitly selling)

### What you’ve consistently said (and it’s coherent)

* **Local-first ERP for makers / small shops**
* **No cloud. No subscriptions. No “rent your own data.”**
* **Ships fast, stable, boring-on-purpose**
* **You’re an operator-builder** (not “idea guy”)
* **Core is free/open; Pro is paid polish/power beside Core (doesn’t corrupt Core)**

### What that position attracts (we saw this in who viewed you)

* People who hate SaaS creep / lock-in
* People who care about “boring” engineering trust signals
* Seniors / big-company folks watching indie builders (your analytics showed a surprisingly “senior + 10k+ employees” slice)

---

## 1) What content formats you’ve tested (and outcomes)

### A) “Shipping loop” post (build → ship → break → fix → ship)

* **Goal:** identity signal + founder mindset + invite questions
* **Observed:** impressions happen, but comments/reactions stayed low.
* **Issue:** the hook is relatable, but it’s still abstract unless paired with *one concrete screenshot + one concrete question*.

### B) “I asked r/selfhosted…” feedback post (trust checklist)

* **Goal:** show you seek hard feedback + credibility via community validation
* **Observed:** this was one of the strongest *credibility plays* because it contains:

  * proof you’re building in the open
  * proof external people can sanity-check you
  * a concrete, boring checklist (which builders respect)
* **Outcome:** solid positioning; still not huge engagement, but it reads “real”.

### C) “BUS Core Pro landing page / coming soon” screenshot post

* **Goal:** announce Pro + seed early access interest
* **Observed:** early impressions start small (10 impressions / 1 reached immediately after posting)
* **Interpretation:** LinkedIn often “slow rolls” distribution until your network reacts. Early traction depends heavily on **who** sees it first.

### D) “Commenting on other people’s posts” strategy

* **Goal:** farm attention via relevant comments
* **Observed:** you started doing this, and your overall weekly metrics improved modestly:

  * Post impressions up
  * Followers up (small absolute numbers but positive slope)
* **Key note:** This is the fastest lever on LinkedIn when you don’t have a big follower base.

---

## 2) The best “real feedback” you got (high signal)

### r/selfhosted reply (ERP_Architect)

This is the cleanest “product direction” feedback you’ve received so far:

**Self-host trust signals:**

* **Docker / docker-compose** so it runs on NAS / home server easily
* **Clear data storage + backup docs** (snapshot/migrate safely)
* **Stable API contract** (future-proof even if UI changes)
* **Headless-friendly web UI** (not tied to one desktop install)

**Market positioning note they gave you:**

* Local-first + real costing logic is interesting because most self-host tools stop at counts and ignore costing depth.
* If install story is clean + data model transparent, it becomes something people “trust long term”, not just test.

**What you learned from this:**

* The self-host audience does NOT want hype. They want “boring reliability + portability + escape hatch”.
* A desktop-first beta is acceptable, but “can I run it on my homelab and access it from a browser?” is the *default* question.

## 3) What “worked” vs “didn’t” on LinkedIn (so far)

### What worked (in practice)

1. **Concrete artifacts beat abstract philosophy**

   * Screenshots of UI, dashboards, flows, tests, real output → better credibility.
2. **Asking a specific question works better than “thoughts?”**

   * Your best prompt style was:
   * “What breaks first in $1M–$4M ops: wholesale pricing vs inventory allocation vs PO/receiving vs reconciliation?”
3. **Cross-community validation is leverage**

   * “I asked r/selfhosted…” made you look like a builder taking real critique.
4. **You’re getting visibility even without engagement**

   * Your “steady visibility” charts show you’re being seen.
5. **Network building is already moving the needle**

   * Your LinkedIn “actions” count is high (you’re active).
   * Followers increased (again: small totals, but direction matters).

### What didn’t work (or underperformed)

1. **“Interaction bait” didn’t move (yet)**

   * You posted prompts designed to spark comments, but the network isn’t large enough yet.
   * On LinkedIn, engagement is heavily dependent on early reactions from *people with networks*.
2. **A contrarian tone can read as arrogance if you’re not careful**

   * Your draft reply to the “AI bottleneck moved” post:

     * “If I had multiple of me… no bottleneck… bottlenecks are 100% process.”
   * Risk: it sounds like you’re calling everyone else incompetent. That can repel the exact people you’re trying to attract.
3. **Posting into the void feels bad even when it’s “working”**

   * Metrics show visibility, but low comments/reactions means you don’t *feel* traction.
   * That’s normal early-stage LinkedIn: it’s a distribution game + relationship game, not a pure merit game.

---

## 4) Metrics you shared (compiled)

### LinkedIn post analytics snapshots

* One post: **36 impressions**, **18 members reached**, **0 reactions/comments/reposts/saves**, **1 profile viewer**, **0 followers gained**
* Another: **60 impressions** (post shown with “2 comments” visible on the post UI)
* Pro landing page post: **10 impressions**, **1 reached** shortly after posting
* Another analytics screenshot: **20 impressions**, **2 members reached**, 0 engagement

### LinkedIn profile analytics snapshot

* **462 post impressions** (+35.1% past 7 days)
* **5 followers** (+66.7% past 7 days)
* **16 profile viewers** (past 90 days)
* **0 search appearances** (previous week)
* Weekly sharing tracker showed you blew past the “3 actions” target (you were at **22 actions**)

### Audience demographics from one post

* **50% Senior**
* **44% at companies with 10,001+ employees**
  *(This matters: you’re being seen by serious operators, not just hobbyists.)*

---

## 5) What you discovered about distribution (hard truth)

### LinkedIn reality (what your data suggests)

* You can post good stuff and still get low engagement because:

  * small network
  * early viewers don’t react
  * LinkedIn doesn’t broaden distribution
* **Comments on other people’s posts are your best distribution hack right now.**

  * They put you in front of *someone else’s* network.
* “Pro” (LinkedIn Premium) doesn’t magically fix distribution.

  * It helps search/visibility tools, but it doesn’t force engagement.

---

## 6) What you learned about “who to talk to”

### You kept asking “how do I find sellers / ops people?”

Your best-fit targets based on what you’re building:

* **Operators**: shop owners, production managers, farm owners, makers running small teams
* **Ops/RevOps** in messy middle market (inventory, quoting, manufacturing runs)
* **Self-host/homelab** crowd (trust + control + portability)
* **3D print farms** specifically (you opened a door here)

### You made meaningful initial connections

* 2 software people you already know (warm nodes)
* 1 astrophysics connection (family)
* Discord community admins (Steph_3dque) = **high leverage distribution node**

---

## 7) The Discord “Steph_3dque” thread (high leverage event)

### What happened

* You messaged Steph (admin of a popular “3D Print Farms” discord) asking:

  * where to share without spamming
  * whether to post as “looking for testers”
* Their response: **“Let’s get on a call…”** + calendar link.

### What this means (big picture)

* You didn’t just get a “sure post it.”
* You got an *intent-to-engage* response from a community gatekeeper.
* This is the best distribution opportunity you’ve surfaced so far because:

  * 3D print farms have **inventory + costing + workflow** problems
  * communities like tools and share them if they’re clean/self-hostable
  * one admin yes can equal dozens of testers

### What you were worried about (and it’s valid)

* You don’t want to sound like an “inventory rat”
* You want to be casual (polo + fuzzy pants energy)

**Net: your instinct is right. Be casual, but precise.**

---

## 8) Website / GitHub signal (supporting proof you can mention)

### Cloudflare / website analytics snapshot

* In last 24h with bots excluded:

  * Path hits: `/` (17), `/download/` (2), `/docs/` (1), plus a couple misc paths
  * Browser: mostly **Chrome**
  * OS: mostly **Windows**, some MacOS, a little Linux
* Referrers include:

  * direct
  * buscore.ca
  * a couple sketchy/random referrers (common noise)

### GitHub traffic snapshots

* Repo “Visitors” and “Clones” looked strong in your screenshot:

  * Very high clone counts relative to unique visitors (likely some automation/bots/CI, but still indicates attention)
* You were excited because it “looks cool” and it does: it’s proof of eyes.

### Key learning you asked about

* “Will Cloudflare show downloads?”

  * Cloudflare can show **clicks to your /download route**.
  * If the file is hosted on GitHub Releases, GitHub shows **asset download counts** (cleaner “real download” metric).

---

## 9) Messaging adjustments you’ve been circling (what to keep / drop)

### Keep

* “Local-first, no rent, no lock-in” (strong differentiator)
* “Boring on purpose” (trust-building with self-host crowd)
* “Core stays free” (removes suspicion)
* “Pro runs beside Core / doesn’t change Core” (reduces fear)

### Dial back (or sharpen)

* “I built stable product in 8 weeks for $0”

  * Keep the fact, but don’t swing it like a hammer. Use it as “speed + focus” proof, not ego proof.
* “If you have bottlenecks it’s 100% on process”

  * This is the kind of line that wins arguments and loses allies.

### Strongest engagement angle you’ve found

* Ask people to name **the first workflow that breaks** (inventory allocation, quoting/RFQ, receiving, reconciliation, job costing, etc.)
* That makes operators *want to reply* because they have war stories.

---

## 10) Open loops / things still unresolved

These are threads you started but haven’t fully “closed” yet:

1. **A clean LinkedIn strategy for “finding sellers”**

   * You asked: “How do I find sellers on LinkedIn?”
   * You haven’t yet built a repeatable search + connect pattern.

2. **A public “trust checklist” statement**

   * You asked: “Should I document the API is stable and won’t change?”
   * You haven’t written the “compat promise” yet.

3. **Docker / self-host packaging**

   * You believe it can run headless because UI is just browser hitting API.
   * You asked about Docker edge cases (ports, volumes, permissions, etc.) but haven’t formalized.

4. **Reply to the “shipping velocity reveals truth…” commenter (Sam Lawes)**

   * You wanted a reply; you haven’t posted it yet (in this log).

---

## 11) What has *actually* improved over time (trendline)

Even if it feels slow:

* You went from “posts getting basically nothing” to:

  * steady impressions
  * follower growth (small but real)
  * profile views
  * a serious community admin offering a call
  * at least one credible external feedback reply on product direction
* That’s the early funnel: **seen → trusted → introduced → tested**.

---

## 12) Quick “what to do next” list (based on what’s worked)

Not a plan, just the actionable backlog implied by the learnings:

* Add a **“Self-host readiness”** section to README/site:

  * Docker/compose: planned / WIP
  * Data location + backups: explicit
  * API stability statement: explicit
  * Headless access: explicit
* Write a **single “Beta testers wanted”** post that is *operator-first*:

  * “If you run a print farm / small shop: what breaks first?”
* Turn the Steph call into:

  * 5–10 testers
  * 1 pinned Discord post (if allowed)
  * 1 feedback thread template

---

If you want, I can also produce a **single pasteable “LinkedIn Strategy So Far” doc** (1 page) that you can keep as your operating manual: what to post, what to comment, who to connect with, and the exact prompts that are most likely to trigger replies.
