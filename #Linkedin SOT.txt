## 1. LinkedIn – SoT Facts (Condensed from Handover)

`SOT – LINKEDIN CORE FACTS (0.2.0)`

* Account was just created on Nov 27 2025.
* Current performance (from cold start):

  * ~180 impressions over 2 days
  * +1 follower
  * 1 profile view
  * 0 search appearances last week
  * Activity tracker: **7/3 actions** (2 posts, 5 comments)

**Posting behaviour:**

* Two main posts:

  * Post #1: BUS Core intro + Method + Graph of branch history BUS-Core
  * Post #2: BUS Core “stop paying rent” demo gif (wrong-speed version)
* Both posts:

  * Talk to **makers / micro-makers**
  * Emphasize **local-first, self-hosted, ERP alternative**
  * Highlight: “I didn’t write the code, I orchestrated it with SoT + LLMs”
* Results:

  * Post #2: ~95 impressions, reactions, comments, +1 follower, strong engagement for a cold account
  * Post #1 (6h in): ~80 impressions, 18 video views, ~16s avg watch time, 3 reactions, 1 comment
* Decision: **do not** repost or correct the video in-thread → avoid splitting engagement.

**Commenting behaviour:**

* Commenting only where signal is high (AI, LLM workflows, self-hosting, indie tools).
* Style:

  * Contextual, 1–4 sentences, practical
  * No “nice post” spam, no sales hooks
* Effects:

  * “Most relevant” position on other people’s posts
  * Replies + likes from authors (Sal, Nafis, Royse, etc.)
  * Direct traffic → profile → posts

**Positioning:**

* Identity:

  * Maker, not traditional dev
  * Local-first software builder
  * Self-hosting + SoT + LLM orchestration
  * Military background: visible but not central, no flag-waving
* Preferences:

  * No hype, no motivational garbage
  * Data, deltas, repeatable loops
  * Concrete demos, not theory threads

**Platform fit (observed, not “decided”):**

* LinkedIn seems **better** for your niche than Reddit/X:

  * More “permission” to talk about product and method seriously
  * Less hostility to AI-assisted workflows
  * More overlap with indie devs / builders / ops people

**Infra intentions:**

* You want a **SoT repo** just a public SOT hold people can read (likely GitHub, not Notion).
* You like the idea of:

  * `/linkedin/posts/`
  * `/linkedin/comments/`
  * `/linkedin/metrics/`
  * `/linkedin/deltas/`
* You’re okay with making this public because none of it is sensitive.

## 2. Quick Delta – What This Changes For Us (LinkedIn Delta #0)

**(1) NEW FACTS / DECISIONS**

* LinkedIn is now officially part of the Method surface, not a random channel.
* You have *baseline metrics* for a cold account that prove:

  * Your content hooks
  * Comments can get you “most relevant” slots
* You have explicitly decided **not** to fix the video post by reposting → you’re prioritizing coherence over perfection.

**(2) UPDATED NARRATIVE**

* Public story is not just “I built BUS Core.” It’s:

  > “I built BUS Core with a Source-of-Truth method and I’m documenting the journey across X, Reddit, and LinkedIn as a micro study in controlled iteration.”

**(3) CLARIFICATIONS**

* LinkedIn is **not** the primary dev log (that’s GitHub / internal SoT).
* LinkedIn **is** the professional publication layer + journey proof.
* Military is background context, not brand identity.

**(4) OPEN ITEMS**

* Website + waitlist (product-facing) still need to be created and connected.
* Need a simple way to log LinkedIn deltas (probably a markdown template in a repo).
* Need first **formal “journey” post** that explains the experiment without sounding like a manifesto.

**(5) JOURNEY INSIGHT**

* Even with minimal followers, **quality comments + one solid post** are enough to light up the algorithm and pull the right kind of traffic.
* This validates your idea that “small, deliberate emissions” across multiple surfaces are more powerful than one big launch blast.

## 3. Updated LinkedIn Gameplan v0.2 (Pointform)

* **Profile**

  * Keep “BUS Core founder / local-first workshop OS” as your core identity.
  * Add GitHub + (later) product site to Featured.

* **Posts**

  * Max 1 **substantial** post per day.
  * Keep them in three buckets:

    1. Product demos (BUS Core running)
    2. Method / SoT insights
    3. Journey updates (“what changed + what I learned”)

* **Comments**

  * Target: 3–5 **high-signal** comments per active day on:

    * AI dev workflows
    * self-hosting
    * agents / orchestration
    * indie builder stories
  * Keep tone: practical, specific, non-salesy.

* **Tracking**

  * After each post session:

    * Log a tiny delta (5 bullets max) in `/linkedin/deltas/`
    * Capture 1 “journey insight” about how the post/engagement feeds back into BUS Core or the Method.

* **Traffic type**

  * Optimize for:

    * Makers and small shops
    * Builders who might become collaborators / plugin authors
    * People who care about local, not hype SaaS
  * Lightly route them later to: **product site + waitlist** once live.
